# Neural_Networks_Speech_Recognition

This MATLAB script uses the mp3 files in the corresponsing folders as training and test sets. 
The Neural net trains on 5 examples of 5 words, and then is given a test set and tries to predict 
what the word is based on the wav signature.


To get started run the DNN.m (Deep Neural Network) script.

In that file you can adjust the amount of nodes and layers to get the best possible combination. My test results have it
set so that the set parameters produce the optial results
